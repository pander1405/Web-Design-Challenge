<h1>Summary: Lattitude vs X</h1>

<p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator.
    To accomplish this, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.
</p>

<p>After assembling the dataset, we use Matplotlib to plot various aspects of weather vs latitude.
    Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity.
    The site provides the source of data and vizualation created as part of the anaylsis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
